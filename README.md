# Mascap

This is just regular old [Mascarpone](https://github.com/catseye/Mascarpone), but the standard interpreter has more commands out of the box. In particular I aim to implement various languages and improvements to make it suitable for codegolf.

The gimmick of Mascarpone, and indeed Mascap, is that meta-circular interpreters are first class citizens. The only way to do control flow in standard Mascarpone is with higher-order meta-circular interpreters. For more information, please read the Mascarpone language specification by clicking the link above.

Currently Mascap supports a small subset of [Joy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_(programming_language))
